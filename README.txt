##About this fork
This fork of ORMLite attempts to bring support for abstract classes and inheritance to
the original ORMLite-core. The author says this is beyond Lite, but I really like this
framework and I think there should be a version with some basic support for complex
class structures.

Hope to achieve this,
Guillermo Guridi.

##Original description
This package provides the core functionality for the JDBC and Android packages.  Users
that are connecting to SQL databases via JDBC connections will need to download the
ormlite-jdbc package as well. Android users should download the ormlite-android package
as well as this core package.

For more information, see the online documentation on the home page:
